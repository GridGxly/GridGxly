### **Hi There!** <img src="./assets/wave1_transparent.gif" alt="waving face emoji" width="36" />

I’m a software engineer and an undergrad computer science student. I like to build across the board, but my sweet spot is in machine learning and full-stack web/mobile development. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me reading, catching up on a good show, or just getting some fresh air.

I genuinely love the process of learning and creating, whether that's exploring AI, tinkering with low-level systems, or picking up a new framework to solve a problem I'm facing. The best part of this industry is that there’s always something new to build and learn.

My path in tech is constantly evolving, shaped by the people I meet. If you ever want to connect or just talk shop, I'm always down, so feel free to reach out!
