### **Hi There!** <img src="./assets/wave1_transparent.gif" alt="waving face emoji" width="36" />

I'm [Ralph](https://rnoel.dev), an aspiring software engineer and computer science student @ [Valencia College](https://valenciacollege.edu) in Orlando, FL. Currently on the transfer path to UCF.

I've built projects at hackathons like [KnightHacks](https://club.knighthacks.org/) and [SwampHacks](https://swamphacks.com), collaborated on full-stack tools with React and Node. My work sits somewhere between frontend creativity and solving real problems. I like both sides equally.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading, watching anime, learning new things I'm passionate about, and getting some fresh air. 

### Let's connect!
